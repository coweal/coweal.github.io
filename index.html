            We are citizens of the Internet. We are constantly confronted with the challenges of our digital society: bullying, moderators' actions that unintentionally offend regular users, or administrators' decisions that make our favorite online communities silent and empty; trolls, puppets, and other folks who make the lives of community managers and moderators difficult. What if we can avoid all of that and just enjoy participating in online communities?

            We want to create a world where any community related decision gets made based on openly tested hypotheses. For that we are going to date theory and practice, making each nuance of the digital society open and FAIR. Is it real? We do not know, but we are going to find it out together. Join us and help build the community knowledge base on sociology accompanied by analysis tools.
