            We are citizens of the Internet. We are constantly confronted with the challenges of our digital society: bullying, moderator actions that not intentionally offend regular users, or administrationâ€™s decisions that make our favorite online communities silent and empty.

            We want to create a world where any community related decision gets made based on openly tested hypotheses. For that we are going to date theory and practice, making each nuance of the digital society open and FAIR. Is it real? We do not know, but we are going to find it out together! Join us and help build the community knowledge base on sociology accompanied by analysis tools.
